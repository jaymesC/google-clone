This area is full of great / hip restaurants, cafes, and is much quieter than the beatdown and intense downtown/tourist areas of Tokyo. Bar Huddle plays great music (Kosuke has great taste) and has the drinks to quench your thirst! Kosuke is an awesome person and if you wanna learn more about the Japanese culture, chat with locals, get to know other travelers, and go beyond the tourist zones, this is the bar for you! Bring friends, hang, and huddle! Only open Fri/Sat/Sun as far as I know! :)"',
